1. saleid might not be needed since it is an autoincrement
might still use saleid for EDIT SALES page though.

2. might have problems adding several products in at the same time, 
need to do quantity of each, and total price by calculating. ->might not have been negotiated

3. currently, total price would have to be calculated from server side and sent back to client.
need to figure this out, particularly for multiple different items per sale.	

4. until we get add product to work correctly, this might have to be put on hold

5. one other thing to note, should stock be automatically reduced when a sale is made?

6. Display(View) Page:
	- individual searches only or Display All only?
	- use a seperate result page for each search? -> makes layout cleaner. simple copy paste
	- e.g. if we do search product, search sales, view all products, view all sales, thats 4 pages total
	- then main View page will have links to all 4
